Warm Greetings! My name is Ha Manh Do and I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Oklahoma State University (OSU), USA, in 2018 and 2015. I earned the B.S. degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam, in 1999. I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation and Control ([ASCC Lab](https://ascc.okstate.edu/)) at OSU. My primary areas of interests include:

* Mobile Robotics
* Machine Learning
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Computer Vision
* Auditory perception
* Natural Language Processing
* Home Service Robots and Smart Homes for Elderly Care

Apart from research and academics, I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, and practicing mindfulness. I’m a keen sport enthusiast and I love swimming as well as watching football. My favorite team is OSU Cowboys :).

Look around to know more about my research and interests. Thank you for visiting my website!
