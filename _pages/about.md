Warm Greetings! My name is Ha Manh Do and I’m currently a PhD Candidate at Oklahoma State University. I’m working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation and Control (ASCC Lab) under the guidance of Prof. Weihua Sheng. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 1999 (Class KTĐT1-K39). My primary areas of interests include:

* Mobile Robotics
* Machine Learning
* Robot Audition
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Computer Vision

Apart from research and academics, I enjoy playing the tennis, travelling, and practicing mindfulness. I’m a keen sport enthusiast and I love swimming as well as watching the college football. My favorite team is OSU Cowboys :).

Look around to know more about my research and interests. Thank you for visiting my website.
