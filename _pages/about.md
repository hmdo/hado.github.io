Warm Greetings! My name is Ha Manh Do and I earned my M.S. degree in 2015 and is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University (OSU). I received my bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam in 1999. I’m working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation and Control ([ASCC Lab](https://ascc.okstate.edu/)) at OSU under the guidance of Prof. Weihua Sheng. My primary areas of interests include:

* Mobile Robotics
* Machine Learning
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Computer Vision
* Auditory perception
* Natural Language Processing
* Home Service Robots and Smart Homes for Elderly Care

Apart from research and academics, I enjoy playing the tennis, traveling, and practicing mindfulness. I’m a keen sport enthusiast and I love swimming as well as watching the college football. My favorite team is OSU Cowboys :).

Look around to know more about my research and interests. Thank you for visiting my website.
