Warm Greetings! My name is Ha Manh Do. I am currently a [CBASE Postdoctoral Researcher/Professor of the Practice in Engineering](https://www.csupueblo.edu/communities-to-build-active-stem-engagement/research-communities-program.html) at the Department of Engineering, Colorado State University-Pueblo. From Dec. 2018 to May 2019, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation and Control (ASCC Lab), Oklahoma State University. I was in charge of developing robot-integrated smart homes and social robots for elderly care. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Oklahoma State University (OSU), USA, in 2018 and 2015, respectively. I earned the B.S. degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam, in 1999. My primary areas of research interests include:

* Mobile Robotics
* Machine Learning
* Human-Robot Interaction
* Computer Vision
* Auditory perception
* Natural Language Processing
* Home Service Robots and Smart Homes for Elderly Care

Apart from research and academics, I enjoy playing tennis, traveling, and practicing mindfulness. Iâ€™m a keen sport enthusiast and I love swimming as well as watching football. My favorite team is OSU Cowboys :).

Look around to know more about my research and interests. Thank you for visiting my website!
