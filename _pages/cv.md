Research Experiences
=================
* Aug. 2011-Present: Graduate Research Associate, Laboratory for Advanced Sensing, Computation & Control, Oklahoma State University, USA
  * Robot-integrated Smart homes for elderly care
      * Designed and implemented a robot-integrated smart home (RiSH) testbed that consists of a home service robot, a home sensor network, a body sensor network, and a mobile device, cloud servers.
      * The RiSH testbed is employed in developing assistive technologies for the elderly who live independently at home.
  * Auditory learning for home service robots
      * Implemented an auditory perception platform for a home service robot that serves the elderly living alone at home. The robot is able to estimate the sound source position and recognize human speech in the room with multiple sound sources, as well as to collaborate with the caregiver on sound event recognition.
      * Developed context-aware sound event recognition for home service robots using a two-level dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) that models the intra-temporal and inter-temporal constraints among the context and sound events.
  * Human-robot collaboration in a Mobile Visual Sensor Network
      * Developed a framework for human-robot collaboration in a Mobile Visual Sensor Network (MVSN). A collaborative architecture for the proposed human-integrated MVSN was developed to allow the human operator and robots to collaborate to perform surveillance tasks.
* Aug. 2017-Present: Graduate Research Associate, Human Development and Family Science Department, School of Human Sciences, Oklahoma State University, USA
    *  Socio-emotional Maintenance in Aging with Robotic Technology (SMART)      

* Aug. 1999- Jul. 2011, Lecturer, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam
  * Design and Implementation of the portable cable test instrument, 2006  
  * Developed a portable instrument based on the reflected pulse wave method to test the copper cables of subscriber lines in telecommunication systems.
  * Design and Implementation of the development boards, 2001-2009
  * Designed and implemented the development boards: FPGA and ARM9-core MCU board for Video Processing, Xilinx CPLD and FPGA development boards, 8051 microcontroller family development board, Electronics Circuit Experiment Boards driven by the Computer.
  * Design and Implementation of the Internet Based Testing Software for Distance Training Centers of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group, 2001-2002
  * Served as the project’s QA person, inspected codes submitted by programming teams and ensured database’s integrity.
